      <h2>No net, no problem!</h2>
      <p>Ernie is an sms-based personal assistant that gives you various information from the web without having a net. Both input and output are via SMS. It uses natural language as input instead of the traditional "keywords" that you have to memorize so itâ€™s less confusing. The output ranges from Point A to Point B directions, traffic situation, random questions, complex calculations and weather conditions & forecast.</p>
      <p>...BECAUSE KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!</p>
